# Day 1:
## Hello, Python:
Day 1 takes you through learning Python for data science and Machine Learning. This tutorial talks about python syntax, operators more.

# Python Flashback:
This tutorial assumes that you have a basic understanding of any programming language. Please brush up your python skills to take up this learning pathway.
Here's a quick recap of python.

### Hello World For Python:
~~~python
print("Hello World")
~~~
<b> WHAT??? AS SIMPLE AS THAT? </b>
<h1> Yes! You read it right</h1>

### Variable Assignment:
Here we create a variable called var, and give it a value using = operator. Python is a loosely typed language and hence it does not require you to give a datatype to the variable.
~~~python
var=1
print(var)
~~~
### Function Call:
In Python the functions can be called using the parenthesses after the function name and passig the argguments(If any) within them.
Example: print("I am learning Python")

### Operators in Python
* a + b	Addition	
* a - b	Subtraction
* a * b	Multiplication
* a / b	True division
* a // b	Floor division
* a % b	Modulus	Integer remainder after division of a by b
* a ** b	Exponentiation	a raised to the power of b
* -a	Negation	The negative of a

# Python for Data Science:
### Lists in Python
Ordered sequence of values is represented by Lists. 
To create a list:
~~~python
values= [1,2,3,4]
~~~
##### Indexing 
Elements inside a list can be indexed using their respective positions. In python zero based indexing is followed i.e. indexing begins from 0.
##### Slicing 
Slicing is done to derive a subset of an already existing list. It is a very handy technique when dealing with large lists especially in case of huge datasets for Machine Learning or Data Science.
<B>Please note that Lists are "mutable", meaning they can be modified "in place".</B>
