# Assignment 1 
### Know how will we work:
For Machine Learning we will be working around with many tools and technologies. We will use python as the main programming language, an environment to execute our code and many python libraries. 
### Installation Guide:
We would not need installing anything on our local systems. We would work on a cloud based environment called Google Collab. Google Collab lets you use Computation over the cloud.
To learn more about Google Collab, Go to https://collab.research.google.com and study how do they make it happen.
For our learning, we will use the collab to work on python3 notebooks to learn Machine Learning. 

Here are some links to know more about the technologies we would be using. You can briefly study about them for your reference. Anything needed with Machine Learning will be covered in detail during the course of this learning pathway.
