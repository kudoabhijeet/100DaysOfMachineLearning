# Day 0: Let's Prep Well.
### Tale 0: Once Upon a Time
Once Upon a time there lived a developer who wanted to learn a higher computational statistics technique. He understood that it's nothing but Machine Learning. He went through some online tutorials. He then opened a python3 notebook, imported few libraries, trained his data and made some predictions out of it. The predicitions his model made were absolutely phenomenal. He thought he had now mastered Machine Learning. But only until that day when he turned the pages of history and came across the following

Once Upon a time in New Jersey, there lived two neurophysiologists. The year was 1943. They created a model of neuron like network using electrical circuits.

Once upon a time during the world war 2. Germany seemed to be overpowering the Allies. They had discovered a method of sending encrypted messages using Enigma Machine. England then turned on of the prominent mathematician Alan Turing, who during the process of breaking Enigma Machine gave the concept of Artificial Intelligence and developed the famous Turing Machine.

In 1952, Arthur Samuels created a program which could learn. The program was nothing but a checkers game. Later he coined the term "Machine Learning".

In 1958 Frank Rosenblatt created the first artificial neural network to detect shape and patterns. It was called Perceptron.

During the 1980s and 1990s Japan, USA and some other countries started working on advanced neural networks. They emphasised on developing artificial neural networks similar to how neurons actually work in the human body.

In the 21st Century, many projects like Googlebrain, AlexaNet, Deepface, Deepmind were created and the stage was set for Machine Learning to take over.

## In a Nutshell:
##### What is Machine Learning?
Wikipedia defines Machine Learning as,
"The scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions"
##### What does it mean?
You have some mathematical data. Machine Learning is capable of studying that data and derive its own conclusions from it. So in a way you can get a machine to execute one instruction with its own understanding. Machine Learning relies on the patterns and inferences thus is able to do so.
##### What it is not?
It is often said that Machine learning is the future. But Machine learning is not a newly discovered technique rather it has been around since the invention of the Turing machine. In 1952, Arthur Samuels coined the word "Machine Learning". During world war 2, when the Nazis discovered the Enigma, the concept of AI was given by Alan Turing who later went on to discover the popular Turing Machine.
<B>MACHINE LEARNING IS NOT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</B>
ML != AI
But, Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence.
Machine Learning Applications:
Machine learning can be utilized in almost all fields where data is involved. From optimizing computation complexities to simulating human voice, Machine Learning is widely popular. Machine Learning should not be confused with Artificial Intelligence and Deep learning concepts which are nothing but advanced models. To make things clear, Machine Learning and Deep learning are both a subset of Artificial Intelligence. The difference between Machine Learning and Deep learning is that Deep Learning is used with Artificial Neural Networks whereas Machine Learning utilizes structured data to learn.

# Day 0 Assignments:
* Know How Will we work
* Work around with installation and getting started

# Writer's Notes:
<i>Let's not start ML just by directly jumping over it. Let's not learn ML the way the developer mentioned at the beginning of this article did. Machine Learning is much more than importing certain libraries and few algorithms. It is more understanding, applying and discovering solutions. </i>
<strong>Let's Jump to Day one and get started!</strong>
